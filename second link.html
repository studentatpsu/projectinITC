The study of computers and computational systems is known as computer science. Computer scientists primarily work with software and software systems, covering their theory, design, development, and application. Artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database management, HCI, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics, and computing theory are all included in the field of computer science. Computer scientists investigate the performance of computer hardware and software in addition to designing and analyzing methods to solve programs. The challenges that computer scientists face range from the abstract—determining which issues can be solved by computers and the complexity of the algorithms that do so—to the concrete—creating programs that run smoothly on mobile devices, are user-friendly, and adhere to security protocols.
